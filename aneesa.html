      <p> According to a new Social Weather Stations’ (SWS) Survey, 15.5 million 
        of Filipino Families considered themselves poor as of April 2025 with 70% 
        of it coming from Mindanao. In a global perspective, 8.5% of the global 
        population lives in extreme poverty while around 44% of the global 
        population remain poor. Although the number of individuals who live in 
        poverty has greatly decreased since the pandemic time, we can’t  
        ignore that there are still billions of people all over the world who 
        experience this. </p>

    <h1>Why Should We Care About Poverty?</h1>
    <p> These statistics are enough to show us that billions of people 
        struggle to provide basic necessities for their families such as 
        food, water, shelter, and more. Poverty is the root cause why people 
        are starved, children are forced to labor, and countries lack advancements
        in the economy. Poverty is something that we should not take lightly and 
        could be dangerous to the lives of people if not addressed. You may have 
        heard the word “poverty” multiple times already but sometimes we do not 
        recognize the severity of it. These statistics are more than just numbers; 
        they are the lives of people who struggle to make ends meet. </p>

    <h1>What Is Currently Being Done?</h1>
    <p>According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the poverty incidence 
        among the Filipino population was reduced from 18.1% in 2021 to 15.5% 2023. 
        This means that 2.45 million Filipinos are relieved from poverty. This 
        decrease surpassed the target of the government for poverty incidence in 2023. 
        There is also a program called The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) 
        which is a conditional cash program and initiative to provide better education,
        healthcare, and job opportunities.</p>

    <p>Although there was a huge improvement from during the pandemic time, up until 
        this present day there are still a big number of the population who lives 
        in poverty. Bringing the numbers down is not easy and we are being challenged by 
        high income inequality and employment barriers. If we overcome these challenges
        the Philippines will be able to achieve its goal that by 2040, this country will 
        become a middle class society where no one lives in poverty. </p>

    <h1>Where Do We Come In?</h1>
    <p>As a scholar, we are given free quality education out from the money of the 
        public. With this, we should be able to give back to the nation. The 
        scholars of the country should be able to help and solve the problems 
        that are present in our country. We should be the voices of those who 
        can't speak up and should be well-educated enough to help solve these issues. 
        We are given the privilege of education and it's high time that we use it for 
        the betterment of our country. Where issues are present such as poverty, we 
        should be the ones leading our country even if its by small actions like raising 
        awareness.

    <h1>Why Wait For Later, When You Can Do It Now</h1>
    <p>Should we just let these problems continue and become detrimental to the 
        lives of the people, or should we take action to help solve them? Poverty 
        is most often talked about in this country but few or limited are those who
         take actions. It is not enough that we just talk about these problems but 
         we should also have solutions to solve them. Though it’s hard, if we have 
         the willingness to help these people we should be able to overcome 
         challenges. The people are waiting for someone to step up and be the ones who 
         take the initiative. In order to have an inclusive society, let us ensure
            that no one gets left behind.</p>
