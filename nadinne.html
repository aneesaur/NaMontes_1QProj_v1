    <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
    <p>I am Nadinne Chloe J. Montes, a grade 9 student from the Philippine Science
        High School Southern Mindanao Campus whose goal is to help alleviate the problems
        under-privileged families face. The Youth Poverty Advocacy Group (YPAG) is an association 
        with a goal to spread awareness about the causes and effects of poverty as well as informing 
        the public on the possible solutions that can be implemented. This group started
        in 2016 where numerous Philippine Science High School scholars saw the number of 
        families who lived in poverty and decided to establish the YAPG with the core values
        of passion, empathy, and creating an inclusive community. </p>

    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>I am Nadinne Chloe J. Montes, I am 14 years old and a student in the 
        Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus (PSHS-SMC). 
        I came from a comfortable family where we didnâ€™t need to worry about 
        providing basic necessities for survival, but I did grow up seeing a 
        lot of people suffering from poverty. When I was a kid, I saw their 
        challenges and difficulties and at that time, I could not understand why. 
        I wanted to know why they still live in poverty despite working so hard and 
        I wanted to help alleviate their problems.</p>

    <p>When I got into PSHS-SMC, I discovered that we were able to join
         organizations and can even make our own based on our own advocacy. 
         I was so glad that we had this kind of program and support which
         enabled us to to give back to the community. And so, this is one way in 
         helping alleviate that problem, by creating a website to spread awareness.
